## Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Datasets

Below are the datasets I have developed and documented for my research on blockchain-based innovation, tokenomics, and open-source ecosystems. These datasets combine cryptocurrency information and trading data with measures of innovation and economic activity across major blockchain ecosystems, spanning core protocol development and client maintenance, validator behavior, upper-layer applications, and on-chain transactions.
