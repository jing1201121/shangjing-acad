# Blockchain On-Chain Metrics Dataset Schema

This dataset compiles **historical on-chain performance metrics** for major public blockchains between **2010 and 2025**, sourced from two leading analytics platforms — [**DeFiLlama**](https://defillama.com/chains) and [**Artemis Analytics**](https://app.artemisanalytics.com/home).  
It provides standardized time-series data capturing network activity, transaction dynamics, economic performance, and developer deployment trends across multiple ecosystems.

The dataset enables systematic assessment of on-chain activity and capital allocation patterns, offering key indicators for evaluating blockchain network vitality, usage trends, and liquidity distribution.

## Dataset Overview

| Metric | Frequency | Coverage (Chains) | Description |
|---------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Daily Active Addresses** | Daily | ≈60 chains | Number of unique blockchain addresses performing at least one transaction per day — proxy for network user activity. |
| **Daily Transactions** | Daily | ≈60 chains | Count of total on-chain transactions per day — reflects usage intensity and throughput. |
| **Daily Volume** | Daily | ≈60 chains | Total transaction volume (in native tokens equivalent). |
| **Fees** | Daily | ≈60 chains | Aggregate transaction fees paid by users — measures demand for blockspace. |
| **Gas Consumed (Native)** | Daily | ≈60 chains | Total gas units consumed on the network — represents computational workload. |
| **Revenue** | Daily | ≈60 chains | Protocol-level revenue (often fees minus subsidies or burns). |
| **Weekly Contracts Deployed** | Weekly | ≈60 chains | Number of new smart contracts deployed — proxy for developer and innovation activity. |
| **Total Value Locked (TVL)** | Daily | ≈370 chains | Value of digital assets locked in smart contracts — indicator of ecosystem liquidity and adoption. |
