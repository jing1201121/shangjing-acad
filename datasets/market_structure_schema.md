# Blockchain Market Structure Dataset Schema

This dataset describes the **on-chain market and industry structure** of major blockchain ecosystems.  
It is primarily based on data collected from [**DeFiLlama**](https://defillama.com/chains), supplemented with additional temporal attributes that record project and chain activity over time.  

The dataset covers the deployment and evolution of decentralized applications (DApps) across approximately **100 blockchains**, enabling structural analysis of **ecosystem composition**, **sectoral concentration**, and **cross-chain specialization**.
