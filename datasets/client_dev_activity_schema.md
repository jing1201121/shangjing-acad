# GitHub Client Development Activity Dataset Schema

This dataset is generated by a custom **GitHub Data Collector** that continuously retrieves and organizes public activity data from major blockchain-related open-source repositories (e.g., *Ethereum*, *Solana*, *BNB Chain*).  The collector interacts with GitHub’s REST and GraphQL APIs to record commits, pull requests, reviews, issues, and user participation across repositories — producing a structured, relational CSV dataset suitable for quantitative and network analysis.

Each CSV file represents one table in the database and is automatically deduplicated and updated incrementally.  

Collectively, these tables provide a comprehensive temporal record of open-source collaboration and technological innovation within decentralized ecosystems, supporting empirical analysis of **developer networks**, **project evolution**, and **innovation dynamics**.

## Source Description

| Ecosystem | Representative Repositories | Example |
|------------|------------------------------|----------|
| **Ethereum** | [`ethereum/go-ethereum`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), [`ethereum/erigon`](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon), [`hyperledger/besu`](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu) | Core client implementations |
| **Solana** | [`solana-labs/solana`](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana) | Consensus & runtime development |
| **BNB Chain** | [`bnb-chain/bsc`](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc) | EVM-compatible execution client |

These repositories are continuously crawled via GitHub’s REST and GraphQL APIs, with multi-token authentication and concurrent workers for stable and complete data retrieval.
