The long-standing vitality of open-source innovation challenges the classic “public-goods paradox,” while the introduction of token economies provides measurable and traceable channels through which innovation activities may be rewarded. Using Ethereum and Solana as representative cases, the study integrates GitHub developer activity with on-chain economic data to analyze the structural relationship between innovation and revenue distribution within blockchain ecosystems.\nBuilding on the innovation process of blockchain networks and a layered technological stack, my current analysis differentiates protocol-layer from application-layer innovation. Preliminary findings indicate a cyclical dynamic in which demand-driven and supply-driven forces alternate in shaping innovation intensity. During market downturns, ecosystems tend to rely on application-layer innovation to stimulate user demand; during market expansions, rising activity and transaction volume create supply-side pressure that pushes protocol developers to advance scalability- and performance-oriented foundational innovation. As the dominant source of innovation shifts across phases, the structure of value creation and revenue distribution appears to reorganize correspondingly.\nThe core objective of this study is to identify how innovation at different layers of the blockchain stack receives economic rewards, thereby enabling the open-source ecosystem to sustain itself. By linking developer behavior with token-driven value flows, the study provides new empirical grounding and theoretical insight into innovation incentives, value allocation, and system evolution in tokenized open-source environments.\n\n\n\n\nReframing Money: Blockchain-Native Tokens as Endogenous Drivers of Innovation and Growth in Decentralized Economies\nIn cooperation with Dong Zhang (Asst. Prof., Division of Social Science, HKUST)\nWorking Paper, 2025\nSupervisor: Mingxing Liu (Prof., CIEFR, Peking University)\n\n\nAbstract (click to expand)\n\nThis project reframes blockchain-native tokens not merely as financial instruments but as endogenous drivers of innovation and economic expansion in decentralized ecosystems. Existing research often evaluates cryptocurrencies through the traditional functions of money, overlooking their capacity to act as productive capital that coordinates and mobilizes ecosystem growth. This study argues that decentralized, permissionless tokens operate through a mechanism analogous to Schumpeter’s credit-driven innovation cycle, whereby credit creation fuels entrepreneurial experimentation and technological advancement.\nWe term this dynamic the Productive Deflationary Token Regime: by channeling seigniorage toward ecosystem expanders and maintaining incentive stability through deflationary token design, blockchain networks can sustain innovation without relying on state authority or centralized credit issuance. This mechanism supports decentralized, endogenous growth, offering a new perspective on how tokenized systems organize production, reward innovation, and generate long-run economic dynamism.\n\n\n\n\nReturnee Scientists’ Academic Performance and Network Position: A Case Study of a National Key Laboratory in Information Science\nPrincipal Researcher\nFinal Project for the course Advanced Econometrics, 2024\nSupervisor: Qiong Zhu (Asst. Prof., Peking University)\n\n\nAbstract (click to expand)\n\nDrawing on CV information and Scopus publication records for researchers in China’s information-science State Key Laboratories (2016–2021), this study constructs annual co-authorship networks and applies social network analysis to compare the academic performance and collaborative positions of returnee and domestic scholars. Empirically, returnees exhibit higher publication output, greater international collaboration, and higher citation impact—patterns particularly pronounced within CAS-affiliated laboratories. Network evidence shows that returnees in CAS labs tend to occupy peripheral or fragmented positions and rely more on overseas-oriented ties, whereas returnees in university laboratories integrate more readily into core research communities and more frequently serve as bridging actors. Consistently lower clustering coefficients but higher betweenness centrality among returnees highlight their distinctive role as connectors linking domestic and global scientific networks.\n\n\n\n\nUnwilling or Unable to Marry? Marriage Intentions among the Second Generation of Internal Migrants\nIn collaboration with Ran Zhang (Assoc. Prof., PKU), Mingyue Yang, Sihong Ren, Yingquan Song (Assoc. R., CIEFR)\nAccepted: Youth Studies (forthcoming), 2024\nFunding: National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71110107028)\n\n\nAbstract (click to expand)\n\nChina’s second-generation migrants have reached marriageable age, and their mobility experiences broaden life horizons while reshaping marital choices. Traditional norms are disrupted by the individualistic values of destination cities, leading some to develop a preference for not marrying. For those who wish to marry, disadvantaged socioeconomic status and extended career transitions often delay marriage, producing a “cannot marry” dilemma. For men in particular, non-marriage frequently reflects difficulties in cross-regional matching and exclusion from the home-region marriage market."

Using 2011–2021 Shanghai–Shenzhen A-share listed companies, this study examines how digital transformation affects accounting information quality and tests internal control and information asymmetry as underlying mechanisms. Results show a dual impact: digital transformation enhances internal control and improves information quality, yet it also heightens investor disagreement and market asymmetry, harming information quality. The effects differ by ownership type and firms’ Internet attributes, offering new insights into accounting information quality in the digital economy era.\n\n\n\n\nHigh-Speed Railway Expansion, Human Capital Mobility, and Industrial Structure Upgrading\nPrincipal Researcher\nGraduation Thesis (Bachelor of Economics), Excellent final assessment, 2023\nSupervisor: Yaowu Wu（Researcher, IPLE, CASS）\n\n\nAbstract (click to expand)\n\nUsing census microdata from 2010 and 2015 together with HHSR opening records, this study employs a DID design to examine how high-speed rail affects human capital flows across Chinese prefecture-level cities. HSR openings significantly enhance interregional mobility, help HSR cities attract skilled workers, and raise overall human capital levels—especially within the tertiary sector, supporting industrial upgrading. Regionally, HSR drives technology-intensive upgrading in the Bohai Rim and capital-intensive upgrading in the Yangtze River Delta, with no significant effect in the Pearl River Delta. These findings provide policy-relevant evidence on how HSR reshapes human capital allocation and industrial transformation.\n\n\n\n\nLeader of Integrated Revitalization of Alkaline Tomato Industry\nSecond Author\nGold Prize, “Challenge Cup” Entrepreneurship Competition, 2022\nSupervisors: Bin Zhang (IWEP, CASS); Yanru Wang (Prof.,UCASS)\n\n\nAbstract (click to expand)\n\nThis project develops an integrated revitalization model for the alkaline tomato industry by combining agricultural economics, IoT-enabled automation, and data-driven management.
